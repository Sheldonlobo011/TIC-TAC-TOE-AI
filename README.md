# Reinforcement Learning Tic-Tac-Toe

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a reinforcement learning agent using Q-learning. The agent learns to play by playing against itself and updating its value function based on the outcomes of the games.

## Introduction

This project consists of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where an agent learns to make optimal moves through reinforcement learning. The agent uses a Q-learning algorithm to update its value function based on the outcomes of games played against itself.

## Features
- Interactive command-line interface for playing Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Q-learning algorithm for the agent to learn optimal strategies.
- Option to play against the trained agent.

## Getting Started
